How to play:

The game is about learning the 3 core subjects that is English, Mathematics and Science. 
The gameplay is similar, first the user will interact with a cutscene where they can choose whether to start the game immediately or learn how to play the game. 
Once the play option is chosen, the user will enter a scene where the gameplay starts. 
For different subjects there are different gameplays and for the cutscenes, it is pretty much the same only the difference is that it is explaining the different games.

How to play each game:

1.Spelling Game

The spelling game requires the user to drag and drop the missing letters to the corresponding boxes where a certain word is spelled out but a letter is missing. 
The user can interact with the letters by pressing and releasing the letters and an audio of how to pronounce the letter will be played.
The user will also know whether the letter they drag to is correct or wrong as there will be sound effects for correct and wrong answers.

2.Creating Potions Game

This game requires the user to enter the result of calculations that are displayed on the screen. 
The numbers are represented with fruits and elements that are required to create potions. 
The user has to click on the answer box and enter their answer there. Once their answers are written, they have to click on the “enter” key to lock in their answer. 
Their answer will change to a red color if it is wrong and green if it is correct.

3.Animal Sightseeing Game

This game requires the user to drag and drop the corresponding names of the animals to their corresponding images. 
The user can interact with both images and words by clicking the words and hovering over the images. 
When the user clicks on the word, an audio of the word pronunciation will be played and when the cursor is hovered over the images of the animals, 
a live animation of the animal will appear on the platform. 
The user will also know whether the answer is correct or wrong through the audio and the change of color to the text. (red being wrong and green being right)
